**Agile methodology**

Agile methodology, centered on software development, focuses on the idea
of repetitive development involving the constant collaboration of all
interested parts of the project at all stages. It helps the team to
deliver the product with a better quality in less time than expected.

Agile methodologies promote disciplined project management, encouraging
self-organization and teamwork, as well as frequent inspection and
adaptation of the field we're working on. It's intended for a fast and
high-quality delivery of the projects to make.

This method begins with a description of the product from the client
towards the work team, how it is supposed to function and what for. This
step helps the team to certainly know the expectations of the client.
Once the project starts, the work team plans the path to follow, the
execution and evaluation of said project, which might change in the
future to guarantee a better adaptation for the client\'s wants and
needs.![](vertopal_574fa7c2085446bda551b6fdc41b78a3/media/image2.png){width="3.7021259842519685in"

As said, all parts are involved in this, so it is fundamental for
everyone to keep in touch with the process to achieve a better final
product.

## **Scrum** 

Scrum is a subset of agile. In fact, it's the most used subset of agile
methodologies. It is most often used to manage complex software
development using iterative incremental practices. This method increases
productivity and reduces time compared to the waterfall processes. Scrum
enables rapid and smooth adjustments to the changes that the project may
present over time and allows more control over the project status by
needing the team to have regular meetings to discuss where the project
is heading.

These meetings include daily short meetings to dissipate doubts and an
extended weekly meeting to discuss more deeply how the project is going.

Scrum requires a Scrum master to provide an environment where:

1.  A product owner orders the work for a complex problem into a product
    > backlog.

2.  The scrum team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of
    > value during a Sprint.

    > height="3.6746926946631673in"}

3.  The scrum team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust
    > for the next sprint.

4.  Repeat!

A sprint is a short period of time in which a scrum team works to
complete a set amount of work. Sprints are placed in the heart of scrum
and agile methodologies and they're the base to an efficient and
lightweight work.

## **Kanban**

Kanban is also a subset of agile. It's a framework that organizes tasks
by cards added to different columns on a board.

Columns are divided into: backlog, to do, doing, blocked and done. Each
card must be moved to its corresponding column until
*done*.![](vertopal_574fa7c2085446bda551b6fdc41b78a3/media/image8.png){width="3.4218755468066493in"

## **Extreme Programming (XP)**

It belongs to the subsets of agile methodologies as well. Instead of
delivering everything you could possibly want on some date far in the
future, this process delivers the software you need as you need it. This
process encourages developers to respond to customer changes even late
in the cycle of said project.

XP emphasizes teamwork and self-organization as any agile methodology;
managers, customers and developers are all equal partners in a
collaborative team. Implements a simple (yet effective) environment
enabling teams to become highly productive. Extreme Programming develops
a software project in five essential ways: constant and efficient
[communication]{.ul} between all parts involved, a [simple]{.ul} and
clean model of the project, [feedback]{.ul} from testing the project
with the customer, [respect]{.ul} between the team members and their
work, and [courage]{.ul} to respond to future changes and criticism.

## **Git**

Git is a version control system designed for efficiency, confidentiality
and compatibility between all the versions of the project to modify.

What makes it different from other models is its branching
functionality. Git encourages developers to have multiple branches that
can be entirely independent from each other. The creation, merging
(combination) and deletion of said branches takes seconds.

This means you can switch between branches without editing the main one,
have several branches for specific functions, and even create a branch
to experiment with without altering the main branch. Think about it as a
tree! You can cut off one branch, take off some leaves, even paint a
branch if you like, but the trunk itself is never affected. To do this,
we use commands!

### 10 most used commands: 

-   *Git clone:* this command makes an identical copy of the latest
    > version of a project in a repository (an online information
    > deposit) and saves it into your computer. A really easy way to do
    > this is by coding: *git clone
    > \<[[https://name-of-the-repository-link]{.ul}](https://name-of-the-repository-link)\>*

-   *Git branch:* we can use the branch command for, creating, editing
    > and deleting branches.

> To create a new one: *git branch \<branch name\>*. This will create it
> into the local repository.
>
> To push this new branch into the remote repository: *git push -u
> \<remote\> \<branch-name\>*
>
> To view the existent branches: *git branch* or *git branch \--list*
>
> To delete a branch: *git branch -d \<branch-name\>*

-   *Git checkout:* to work on a branch, first we need to switch to it.
    > We use this command to switch from one branch to another. We can
    > also use it for checking out files and commits: *git checkout
    > \<name-of-your-branch\>.*

> To successfully switch between branches you need to follow these
> steps:

-   The changes in your current branch must be committed or stashed
    > before you switch.

-   The branch you want to check out should exist in your local

Of course, there's a shortcut command that allows you to do combine
these and save time: *git checkout -b \<name-of-your-branch\>*

-   *Git status:* this command gives us all the necessary information of
    > the current branch. Like whether the current branch is up to date;
    > whether there is anything to commit, push or even pull; whether
    > there are file to stage, file unstaged or untracked; whether there
    > are files created, modified or deleted. To use it we code: *git
    > status*.

-   *Git add:* when we create, modify or delete a file, these changes
    > will happen in our local and won't be included in the next commit
    > unless we change the configurations. In order to do this, we need
    > to use the git add command to include the changes of a file into
    > our next commit. To add a single file: *git add \<file\>.* And to
    > add everything at once: *git add -A.* We need to make clear that
    > this command DOES NOT change the repository and changes are NOT
    > saved until we use git commit.

-   *Git commit:* used for saving our changes, it's like a checkpoint in
    > a videogame where we can go back later if needed. We need to write
    > a little message to explain what we have developed or changed in
    > the code: *git commit -m "commit message".* This command saves
    > your changes only locally.

-   *Git push:* this one submits your commits to the remote repository:
    > *git push \<remote\> \<branch-name\>*

-   Nonetheless, if your branch is fresh out of the oven, you also need
    > to upload the branch with this command right here: *git push -
    > -set-upstream \<remote\> \<name-of-your-branch\>* or *git push -u
    > origin \<branch_name\>.* This command only uploads changes that
    > are commited.

-   *Git pull:* this command is used to get updates from the remote
    > repository. It gets the updates from the repository and
    > immediately applies the latest changes into your local: *git pull
    > \<remote\>.*

-   *Git revert:* this one is used to undo our changes locally or
    > remotely, [carefully.]{.ul} To see our commit history, we need to
    > use *git log--online.* Then we just need to specify the code next
    > to our wanted commit: *git revert \<commit number\>.* This action
    > will deploy a window like this one but we just have to press
    > *shift + q* to
    > exit.![](vertopal_574fa7c2085446bda551b6fdc41b78a3/media/image1.png){width="3.4583333333333335in"
    > height="2.1041666666666665in"}

> The git command will undo the given commit, but will create a new
> commit without deleting the older one. The advantage of using this
> little command is that it doesn't touch the commit history, with which
> you can still see all of the previous information in your history,
> even the reverted ones.
>
> Another advantage is that everything happens in our local system
> unless we push it into the remote repository. This is why git revert
> is safer to use.

-   *Git merge:* this command is the final step, for when you've
    > completed development in your branch and you are sure that
    > everything works just fine. We are going to merge the branch
    > (including all of its commits) with the dev branch using: *git
    > merge.* It's important to keep in mind that you first need to be
    > on the specific branch you want to merge with your feature branch.

> First, we need to switch to the dev branch by using: *git checkout
> dev*. Before merging, we have to update our local dev branch by
> coding: *git fetch*. Finally, we can merge the feature branch into the
> dev branch by using: *git merge \<branch-name\>.* Make sure our dev
> branch has the latest version before we merge our branches, or we may
> have some conflicts to resolve.

###  **Tags and commits:**

A tag is a feature of git. A specific point in the repository can be
identified by defining the tag for that point. It is used to move
between versions of the repository without altering them. The tag can be
created for a specific commit of the git history. It\'s better to know
how to create the tag for the repository before adding a tag to a
specific commit.

To create a new tag, we need to execute: *git tag \<tagname\>.* We
substitute *tagname* with a specific semantic name. A common pattern to
use are numbers of the version, like *1.04.2.*

###  **Stash**

This command (*git stash)* stores temporally the changes that have been
made in the code we\'re working on so we can work on another code and,
later on, we can come back and apply the wanted changes. It is practical
if you need to deal with other things constantly and rapidly but you
don\'t have the changes in the code finished to confirm and submit. Keep
in mind that the stash is only local and changes effectuated don\'t
transfer to the server when uploaded to the repo.

At this point, we have the liberty to go to another branch and put in
practice all we\'ve learned before with git, then once we\'re ready,
come back and apply the stash.

We can also apply a stash change using the command *git stash pop*. Once
we *pop* the stash, changes in it will be deleted and applied again to
the code we\'re working on.

Another option is to apply again the changes in the code we\'re working
on and keep them in our stash using the command *git stash apply.* This
is really useful if you want to apply the same changes of a stash in
several branches.

Also, we can use *git stash* multiple times to create several *stashes*,
and then use *git stash list* to visualize them. We can identify slashes
by the word \"WIP\" which stands for \"work in progress\" in the upper
part of the branch.

###  **Hooks**

This is the way git has to fire off custom scripts when certain
important actions occur. They can be divided in two groups: server-side
and client-side. Client-side Hooks are triggered by operations such as
committing and merging. While server-side hooks run on network operation
such as receiving pushed commits. The most used commands are
*pre-commit* and *pre-push.*

###  **Branching strategies and GitFlow**

A branching strategy is a set of rules that a work team develops when
writing, merging and deploying code when using a VCS. These rules enable
the team the possibility of stipulating how they interact with a shared
codebase.

Such strategy is necessary as it helps to keep the repository organized
to avoid errors in its application.
![](vertopal_574fa7c2085446bda551b6fdc41b78a3/media/image6.png){width="3.1458333333333335in"
height="1.7395833333333333in"}

GitFlow is a branching strategy. This one enables parallel development
in a branch separated from the main branch. After said changes, the
developer merges this branch into the main one. This branching strategy
consist of these branches:

-   Main.

-   Development.

-   Feature (to develop new features that branches off the develop
    > branch).

-   Release (to help a new production release; usually branched from the
    > develop branch and must be merged both into the develop and main
    > branches).

-   Hotfix. This one also helps to prepare for a release, but -unlike
    > the release one- the hotfix branch will emerge if there's a bug
    > that needs to be solved. It enables developers to work on a
    > different branch while said bug is being fixed.

The *main* and the *develop* branches are considered to be the main ones
to work on, while the rest are supportive branches that are meant to
help developers to, well, develop, and are usually short-lived.
