**Agile methodology**

Agile methodology, centered on software development, focuses on the idea
of repetitive development involving the constant collaboration of all
interested parts of the project at all stages. It helps the team to
deliver the product with a better quality in less time than expected.
![](vertopal_af37018e995a4078973b558dd93d87fc/media/image16.jpg){width="3.7031255468066493in"
height="2.505323709536308in"}

Agile methodologies promote disciplined project management, encouraging
self-organization and teamwork, as well as frequent inspection and
adaptation of the field we're working on. It's intended for a fast and
high-quality delivery of the projects to make.

This method begins with a description of the product from the client
towards the work team, how it is supposed to function and what for. This
step helps the team to certainly know the expectations of the client.
Once the project starts, the work team plans the path to follow, the
execution and evaluation of said project, which might change in the
future to guarantee a better adaptation for the client\'s wants and
needs.![](vertopal_af37018e995a4078973b558dd93d87fc/media/image4.png){width="3.7021259842519685in"
height="2.932292213473316in"}

As said, all parts are involved in this, so it is fundamental for
everyone to keep in touch with the process to achieve a better final
product.

## **Scrum** 

Scrum is a subset of agile. In fact, it's the most used subset of agile
methodologies. It is most often used to manage complex software
development using iterative incremental practices. This method increases
productivity and reduces time compared to the waterfall processes. Scrum
enables rapid and smooth adjustments to the changes that the project may
present over time and allows more control over the project status by
needing the team to have regular meetings to discuss where the project
is heading.

These meetings include daily short meetings to dissipate doubts and an
extended weekly meeting to discuss more deeply how the project is going.

Scrum requires a Scrum master to provide an environment where:

1.  A product owner orders the work for a complex problem into a product
    > backlog.

2.  The scrum team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of
    > value during a Sprint.
    > ![](vertopal_af37018e995a4078973b558dd93d87fc/media/image14.jpg){width="4.151042213473316in"
    > height="3.6746926946631673in"}

3.  The scrum team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust
    > for the next sprint.

4.  Repeat!

A sprint is a short period of time in which a scrum team works to
complete a set amount of work. Sprints are placed in the heart of scrum
and agile methodologies and they're the base to an efficient and
lightweight work.

## **Kanban**

Kanban is also a subset of agile. It's a framework that organizes tasks
by cards added to different columns on a board.

Columns are divided into: backlog, to do, doing, blocked and done. Each
card must be moved to its corresponding column until
*done*.![](vertopal_af37018e995a4078973b558dd93d87fc/media/image17.png){width="3.4218755468066493in"

height="3.088975284339458in"}

## **Extreme Programming (XP)**

It belongs to the subsets of agile methodologies as well. Instead of
delivering everything you could possibly want on some date far in the
future, this process delivers the software you need as you need it. This
process encourages developers to respond to customer changes even late
in the cycle of said project.

XP emphasizes teamwork and self-organization as any agile methodology;
managers, customers and developers are all equal partners in a
collaborative team. Implements a simple (yet effective) environment
enabling teams to become highly productive. Extreme Programming develops
a software project in five essential ways: constant and efficient
[communication]{.ul} between all parts involved, a [simple]{.ul} and
clean model of the project, [feedback]{.ul} from testing the project
with the customer, [respect]{.ul} between the team members and their
work, and [courage]{.ul} to respond to future changes and criticism.

## **Git**

Git is a version control system designed for efficiency, confidentiality
and compatibility between all the versions of the project to modify.

What makes it different from other models is its branching
functionality. Git encourages developers to have multiple branches that
can be entirely independent from each other. The creation, merging
(combination) and deletion of said branches takes seconds.

This means you can switch between branches without editing the main one,
have several branches for specific functions, and even create a branch
to experiment with without altering the main branch. Think about it as a
tree! You can cut off one branch, take off some leaves, even paint a
branch if you like, but the trunk itself is never affected. To do this,
we use commands!

### 10 most used commands: 

-   *Git clone:* this command makes an identical copy of the latest
    > version of a project in a repository (an online information
    > deposit) and saves it into your computer. A really easy way to do
    > this is by coding: *git clone
    > \<[[https://name-of-the-repository-link]{.ul}](https://name-of-the-repository-link)\>*

-   *Git branch:* we can use the branch command for, creating, editing
    > and deleting branches.

> To create a new one: *git branch \<branch name\>*. This will create it
> into the local repository.
>
> To push this new branch into the remote repository: *git push -u
> \<remote\> \<branch-name\>*
>
> To view the existent branches: *git branch* or *git branch \--list*
>
> To delete a branch: *git branch -d \<branch-name\>*

-   *Git checkout:* to work on a branch, first we need to switch to it.
    > We use this command to switch from one branch to another. We can
    > also use it for checking out files and commits: *git checkout
    > \<name-of-your-branch\>.*

> To successfully switch between branches you need to follow these
> steps:

-   The changes in your current branch must be committed or stashed
    > before you switch.

-   The branch you want to check out should exist in your local

Of course, there's a shortcut command that allows you to do combine
these and save time: *git checkout -b \<name-of-your-branch\>*

-   *Git status:* this command gives us all the necessary information of
    > the current branch. Like whether the current branch is up to date;
    > whether there is anything to commit, push or even pull; whether
    > there are file to stage, file unstaged or untracked; whether there
    > are files created, modified or deleted. To use it we code: *git
    > status*.

-   *Git add:* when we create, modify or delete a file, these changes
    > will happen in our local and won't be included in the next commit
    > unless we change the configurations. In order to do this, we need
    > to use the git add command to include the changes of a file into
    > our next commit. To add a single file: *git add \<file\>.* And to
    > add everything at once: *git add -A.* We need to make clear that
    > this command DOES NOT change the repository and changes are NOT
    > saved until we use git commit.

-   *Git commit:* used for saving our changes, it's like a checkpoint in
    > a videogame where we can go back later if needed. We need to write
    > a little message to explain what we have developed or changed in
    > the code: *git commit -m "commit message".* This command saves
    > your changes only locally.

-   *Git push:* this one submits your commits to the remote repository:
    > *git push \<remote\> \<branch-name\>*

-   Nonetheless, if your branch is fresh out of the oven, you also need
    > to upload the branch with this command right here: *git push -
    > -set-upstream \<remote\> \<name-of-your-branch\>* or *git push -u
    > origin \<branch_name\>.* This command only uploads changes that
    > are commited.

-   *Git pull:* this command is used to get updates from the remote
    > repository. It gets the updates from the repository and
    > immediately applies the latest changes into your local: *git pull
    > \<remote\>.*

-   *Git revert:* this one is used to undo our changes locally or
    > remotely, [carefully.]{.ul} To see our commit history, we need to
    > use *git log--online.* Then we just need to specify the code next
    > to our wanted commit: *git revert \<commit number\>.* This action
    > will deploy a window like this one but we just have to press
    > *shift + q* to
    > exit.![](vertopal_af37018e995a4078973b558dd93d87fc/media/image10.png){width="3.4583333333333335in"
    > height="2.1041666666666665in"}

> The git command will undo the given commit, but will create a new
> commit without deleting the older one. The advantage of using this
> little command is that it doesn't touch the commit history, with which
> you can still see all of the previous information in your history,
> even the reverted ones.
>
> Another advantage is that everything happens in our local system
> unless we push it into the remote repository. This is why git revert
> is safer to use.

-   *Git merge:* this command is the final step, for when you've
    > completed development in your branch and you are sure that
    > everything works just fine. We are going to merge the branch
    > (including all of its commits) with the dev branch using: *git
    > merge.* It's important to keep in mind that you first need to be
    > on the specific branch you want to merge with your feature branch.

> First, we need to switch to the dev branch by using: *git checkout
> dev*. Before merging, we have to update our local dev branch by
> coding: *git fetch*. Finally, we can merge the feature branch into the
> dev branch by using: *git merge \<branch-name\>.* Make sure our dev
> branch has the latest version before we merge our branches, or we may
> have some conflicts to resolve.

###  **Tags and commits:**

A tag is a feature of git. A specific point in the repository can be
identified by defining the tag for that point. It is used to move
between versions of the repository without altering them. The tag can be
created for a specific commit of the git history. It\'s better to know
how to create the tag for the repository before adding a tag to a
specific commit.

To create a new tag, we need to execute: *git tag \<tagname\>.* We
substitute *tagname* with a specific semantic name. A common pattern to
use are numbers of the version, like *1.04.2.*

###  **Stash**

This command (*git stash)* stores temporally the changes that have been
made in the code we\'re working on so we can work on another code and,
later on, we can come back and apply the wanted changes. It is practical
if you need to deal with other things constantly and rapidly but you
don\'t have the changes in the code finished to confirm and submit. Keep
in mind that the stash is only local and changes effectuated don\'t
transfer to the server when uploaded to the repo.

At this point, we have the liberty to go to another branch and put in
practice all we\'ve learned before with git, then once we\'re ready,
come back and apply the stash.

We can also apply a stash change using the command *git stash pop*. Once
we *pop* the stash, changes in it will be deleted and applied again to
the code we\'re working on.

Another option is to apply again the changes in the code we\'re working
on and keep them in our stash using the command *git stash apply.* This
is really useful if you want to apply the same changes of a stash in
several branches.

Also, we can use *git stash* multiple times to create several *stashes*,
and then use *git stash list* to visualize them. We can identify slashes
by the word \"WIP\" which stands for \"work in progress\" in the upper
part of the branch.

###  **Hooks**

This is the way git has to fire off custom scripts when certain
important actions occur. They can be divided in two groups: server-side
and client-side. Client-side Hooks are triggered by operations such as
committing and merging. While server-side hooks run on network operation
such as receiving pushed commits. The most used commands are
*pre-commit* and *pre-push.*

###  **Branching strategies and GitFlow**

A branching strategy is a set of rules that a work team develops when
writing, merging and deploying code when using a VCS. These rules enable
the team the possibility of stipulating how they interact with a shared
codebase.

Such strategy is necessary as it helps to keep the repository organized
to avoid errors in its application.
![](vertopal_af37018e995a4078973b558dd93d87fc/media/image2.png){width="3.1458333333333335in"
height="1.7395833333333333in"}

GitFlow is a branching strategy. This one enables parallel development
in a branch separated from the main branch. After said changes, the
developer merges this branch into the main one. This branching strategy
consist of these branches:

-   Main.

-   Development.

-   Feature (to develop new features that branches off the develop
    > branch).

-   Release (to help a new production release; usually branched from the
    > develop branch and must be merged both into the develop and main
    > branches).

-   Hotfix. This one also helps to prepare for a release, but -unlike
    > the release one- the hotfix branch will emerge if there's a bug
    > that needs to be solved. It enables developers to work on a
    > different branch while said bug is being fixed.

The *main* and the *develop* branches are considered to be the main ones
to work on, while the rest are supportive branches that are meant to
help developers to, well, develop, and are usually short-lived.

###  **Rebase**

In git, this is a command that integrates the changes from one branch to
another, and works as an alternative for the "merge" command. Most
visibly, this command differs from the other by rewriting the commit
history in order to produce a 'linear' succession of commits.

To do this we code *git rebase*.

###  **Squash**

With this command, we can combine multiple commits into one. We can do
this at any point in time but it's most often used when we want to
finally merge a branch. It's important to note that there's no *git
squash* to do this, it's an option when using other commands like rebase
or merge.

Teams often use 'squashing' when they have way too many commits and
prefer to use only one, however, in teams with junior developers, it's
not that common so as they won't have the commit history to check on.

### **Rebase vs merge**

  Rebase                                                                                             Merge
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Allows developers to integrate changes from one branch to another.                                 This command allows developers to merge branches.
  Logs are linear in git rebase as the commits are rebased.[^1]                                      With this one, the logs will be showing the complete history of the merging of commits.
  All the commits will be rebased and the same number of commits will be added to the main branch.   All the commits on the feature branch will be combined as a single commit in the main branch.
  This **should** be used when the target branch is a private branch.                                Merge is used when the target branch is a shared branch.

# **JavaScript**

It's the third part of the holy trinity of programming along with HTML
and CSS. JavaScript is a programming language or a commands' sequence
that allows us to implement complex functions in a web page. This
language is oriented to objects and gives the webpage its functionality.

Having previous knowledge in HTML and CSS is a recommendation to take
care of.

### **Syntax**

This is the set of rules under which JS programs are constructed.

To create a variable:

var x;

var y;

To use them:

x = 5;

y = 6;

let z = x + y;

The JS syntax defines two types of values: fixed and variable. Fixed
values are called "literals" and variable values are called "variables".

### [Concepts to keep in mind]{.ul}

-   Object oriented programming (OOP): is a programming style that
    > relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to
    > structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code
    > blueprint (called classes), which are used to create individual
    > instances of objects.

-   Class: it's an abstract blueprint used to create more specific,
    > concrete objects. Classes often represent wide categories like
    > "car" or "dog" that share attributes. These classes define what
    > attributes an instance of this type will have, like *color*, but
    > not the value of those attributes for a specific object. Classes
    > can also contain functions, called *methods* that are available
    > only to objects of that type. These functions are defined within
    > the class, and perform some action helpful to that specific type
    > of object.
    > ![](vertopal_af37018e995a4078973b558dd93d87fc/media/image9.png){width="4.109375546806649in"
    > height="3.9411548556430445in"}

    -   Class templates: these are used as a blueprint to create
        > individual objects. These represent specific examples of the
        > abstract class, like *myCar* or *goldenRetriever*. Each object
        > can have unique values to the properties defined in the class.

```{=html}

-   Variable: it is a value that can change, depending on conditions or
    > on information passed to the program. Typically, a program
    > consists of instructions that tell the computer what to do and the
    > data that the program uses when it's running. Echa data type

    > supplied to the object when said object is being used.

> JavaScript variables can be: numbers, strings, objects, arrays and

> There are four ways to declare a JavaScript variable:

-   Using *var*

-   Using *let*

-   Using *const*

-   Using nothing :)

[When to use *var*]{.ul}

Always declare JS variables using one of the options above. The *var*
keyword is used in all JS code from 1995 to 2015. The *let* and *const*
keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015, so if we want our code to run
in older browsers, we must use *var*.

[When to use *const* and *let*]{.ul}

If we want to generalize a rule, we must declare the variables with
*const*. If the value of the variable can change, we use *let*.

![](vertopal_af37018e995a4078973b558dd93d87fc/media/image12.png){width="7.193349737532809in"
height="2.766673228346457in"}

### **Hoisting** 

This is JS' default behavior of moving declarations to the top.

In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used. In
other words, a variable can be used before it has been declared. The
next examples give the same results:

![](vertopal_af37018e995a4078973b558dd93d87fc/media/image1.png){width="6.296875546806649in"
height="2.1960629921259844in"}

![](vertopal_af37018e995a4078973b558dd93d87fc/media/image11.png){width="6.306590113735783in"
height="1.8941294838145233in"}

To understand this term better, we can say that hoisting is javaScript's
default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current
scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).

Variables defined with *let* and *cons* are hoisted to the top of the
block, but not *initialized*. Meaning that the block of code is aware of
the variable, but it can't be used until it has been declared. Using a
*let* variable before it's declared will result in a
[ReferenceError]{.ul}*.* The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from
the start of the block until it is declared.

JS only hoists declarations, not initializations.

Hoisting is, mostly, an unknown or overlooked behavior of JS. if a
developer does not understand hoisting, programs may contain bugs. To
avoid them, we tend to always declare variables at the beginning of
every scope. It is always a good practice since this is how JavaScript
interprets the code. It is important to note that JS in strict mode
doesn't allow variables to be used if they are not declared.

### **DOM**

With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create
dynamic HTML:

-   It can change: all the HTML elements in the page, all the HTML
    > attributes in the page and all the CSS styles in the page.

-   It can remove existing HTML elements and attributes.

-   It can add new HTML elements and attributes.

-   It can react to all existing HTML events in the page.

-   It can create new HTML events on the page.

The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for
HTML and it defines:

-   The HTML elements as objects.

-   The properties of all html elements.

-   The methods to access all HTML elements.

-   The events for all HTML elements.

Basically, is a standard for how to get, change, add or delete HTML
elements.

### **Scope** 

It determines the accessibility (visibility) or variables. There are
three types of scope: block scope, function scope and global scope.

[Block scope]{.ul}

It is provided by the keywords *let* and *const*. Variables declared
inside a { } block can't be accessed from outside the block. For
example:

{

let x = 2;

}

/ / x can not be used here

Variables declared with the *var* keyword cannot have block scope.
Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the
block. For example:

{

var x = 2;

}

/ / x can be used here

[Local scope]{.ul}

Variables declared within a JS function become local to the function.
For example:

/ / code here can not use carName

function myFunction() {

let carName = "Volvo";

/ / code here can use carName

}

/ / code here can not use carName

Local variables have Function Scope, they can only be accessed from
within the function.

Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions,
variables with the same name can be used in different functions. Local
variables are created when a function starts and deleted when the
function is completed.

[Function scope]{.ul}

With this, each function creates a new scope. Variables defined inside a
function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
Variables declared with *var, let* and *cons* are quite similar when
declared inside a function. They all have function scope:

function myFunction() {

var carName = "Volvo"; / / Function Scope

}

function myFunction() {

let carName = "Volvo"; / / Function Scope

}

function myFunction() {

const carName = "Volvo"; / / Function Scope

}

[Global JavaScript Variables]{.ul}

A variable declared outside a function, becomes global. For example:

let carName = "Volvo";

/ / code here can use carName

function myFunction() {

/ / code here can also use carName

}

If a global variable has global scope, all scripts and functions on a
web page can access it.

[Global scope]{.ul}

Variables declared globally, or outside any function, have global scope.
These variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JS program. Variables
declared with *var, let* and *cons* are similar when declared outside a
block. For example:

var x = 2; / / global scope

let x = 2; / / global scope

const = 2; / / global scope

### **Strict mode** 

"Use strict" it's not a statement, but a literal expression. Its purpose
is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode". With
this mode we can't, for example, use undeclared variables. All modern
browsers support this mode except Internet Explorer 9 and lower. It
helps us write a cleaner code.

Strict mode is declared by adding ["use strict";]{.ul} to the beginning
of a script or a function. By being declared at the beginning of a
script, it has global scope, meaning that all the code in the script
will be executed in strict mode. For example:

"use strict";

x = 3.14; / / this will cause an error because x is not declared

"use strict";

myFunction();

function myFunction() {

y = 3.14;

} / / this will also cause an error because y is not declared

Declared inside a function, it has local scope, that means that only the
code inside the function is in strict mode:

x = 3.14; / / this will not cause an error.

myFunction();

function myFunction() {

"use strict";

y = 3.14;

} / / this will cause an error

[Syntax]{.ul}

The syntax for declaring strict mode was designed to be compatible
versions of JS. Compiling a numeric literal (4+5;) or a string literal
("John Doe\'\';) in a JavaScript program has no side effects, it just
compiles to a non existing variable and dies. ["use strict";]{.ul} only
matters to new compilers that "understand" the meaning of it.

Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JS. It changes previously
accepted "bad syntax" into real errors. For example in normal JS,
mistyping a variable name creates a new global variable; with strict
mode, this will throw an error, making it possible to accidentally
create a global variable. In normal JS, a developer won't receive any
error feedback assigning values to non-writable properties; in strict
mode, any assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property,
a non-existing property, a non-existing variable or a non-existing
object, will throw an error.

[What is not allowed in strict mode]{.ul}

-   Using a variable without declaring it (objects are variables too).

-   Using an object without declaring it.

-   Deleting a variable or object.

-   Deleting a function.

-   Duplicating a parameter name.

-   Octal numeric literals.

-   Octal escape characters.

-   Writing to a read-only property.

-   Writing to a get-only property.

-   Deleting an undeletable property.

-   The word *eval* can't be used as a variable.

-   The word *arguments* cannot be used as a variable.

-   The *with* argument is not allowed.

-   For security reasons, *eval()* is not allowed to create variables in
    > the scope from which it was called.

-   The *this* keyword in functions behaves differently in strict mode.
    > It refers to the object that called the function. If the object is
    > not specified, functions in strict mode will return *undefined*
    > and functions in normal mode will return the global object
    > (window).

-   Keywords reserved for future JS versions can't be used as variable
    > names in strict mode. They are: implements, interface, let,
    > package, private, protected, public, static, yield.

It is important to note that the "use strict" directive is only
recognized at the beginning of a script or a function.

# **HTML**

"HTML" stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It's one of the three main
used programming languages along with CSS and JavaScript. This one
describes and delimits the skeleton of the web page.

To use this type of language, we need a text editor, like "Visual Studio
Code", to give an example. We also need a web browser. The purpose of a
web browser (like chrome, for example) is to read HTML documents and
display them correctly.

A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how
to display the document.

HTML consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to
display the content. These elements label pieces of content such as
"this is the heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

An element is defined by a start tag, some content and an end or closing
tag: \<tagname\> content goes here... \</tagname\>. It is everything
from the start tag to the closing tag. It's important to note that not
all elements need a closing tag, like de \<br\> tag.

### **Elements**

There are several types of elements, but the most basic and common used
ones are:

-   \<!DOCTYPE html\>: is a declaration that establishes this document
    > as a HTML5 document.

-   \<html\>: is the root element of an HTML page.

-   \<head\>: these elements contains meta information[^2] about the
    > HTML page.

-   \<title\>: this element specifies a tite for the page, which is
    > shown in the browser's title bar ir in the page's tab.

-   \<body\>: defines the main content of the page (like the body of a
    > letter), and is a container for all the visible contents such as
    > paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, headings, etc.

-   \<div\>: divides the content in sections. Visually, it does nothing
    > to the page, but helps to organize the code.

-   \<h1\>: stands for heading and defines, of course, a heading. There
    > are also other sizes of heading, \<h2\>, \<h3\>, \<h4\>, etc. each
    > one will be smaller as the number increases. We can use these to
    > create titles, subtitles, and so on.

-   \<p\>: this element describes a paragraph.

-   \<strong\>: makes the text bold.

-   \<em\>: stands for "emphasize" and changes the text's font into
    > cursive.

-   \<small\>: makes the text smaller, really subtle.

-   \<ul\>: stands for "unordered list" and closes vertically just like
    > the html, head and body tags. Between these tags we code \<li\>
    > tags.

-   \<li\>: these provide a list made with ballpoints.

-   \<ol\>: stands for "ordered list" and creates a list organized by
    > numbers starting on 1.

-   \<img\>: is used to add an image. By itself it does absolutely
    > nothing. *Also does not need a closing tag.* To tell the browser
    > what image to show, we use an attribute.

An attribute is something inside the tags that gives more information to
the browser about that tag. For images we use the "src" (source)
attribute like this:

> \<img src= ".png"\>

The .png file has been previously dragged inside of the working sheet;
we just create a path that connects them by using that command. We can
also cluster images inside a folder; in that case instead it would be
coded as:

\<img src= "img/.png"\>

The "alt" attribute is a text representation of the image. It's used to
describe the image for screen readers. Does not have a visual effect, is
for accessibility.

We do not *need* to remember all of these and other commands to be a
good developer, but we *must know* how to use them. We must understand
the bases to create a good path of development.

### **Inputs and forms**

An \<input\> is an element that allows us to create interactive controls
for forms based on the web to collect users information.

An HTML form is used to collect users\' input. The users' input is often
sent to a server for processing.

To create a form for users' input, we use the \<form\> element and it
does have a closing tag. It's a container for different types of input
elements, such as text fields, checkboxes, submit buttons, etc.

The \<input\> element is the most frequently used for forms. This type
of element can be used in many ways, depending on the *type* attribute.
For example:

-   \<input type= "text"\>: displays a single-line text input field.

-   \<input type= "radio"\>: displays a radio button for selecting one
    > of many choices.

-   \<input type= "submit"\>: this one displays a submit button for
    > submitting the form, of course.

-   \<input type= "button"\>: displays a simple clickable button :).

### **HTML vs XHTML**

XHTML stands for "Extensible Hypertext Markup Language\'\' and is
considered as a part of the XML markup language. It can also be
considered as a combination between HTML and XML.

XML is a software and hardware -independent tool for storing and
transporting data. It stands for "eXtensible Markup Language" and was
designed to be self-descriptive. It doesn't do quite anything, it's just
information wrapped in tags.

Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive, store or
display it.

HTML and XHTML were designed with different goals. While HTML5 was
created to solve some of the existing cross-browser compatibility
problems, XHTML was thought of as a more rigorous version of HTML.

Some of the main differences:

-   HTML accepts that not all the elements present a closing tag,
    > whereas XHTML expects that all elements with no exception include
    > a closing tag.

-   XHTML requires that all attribute values, like the font size, are
    > quoted, even the numeric ones. Which does not happen with HTML.

-   For a document to be valid with XHTML, attributes can not be
    > minimized.

### **Data attributes**

They allow us to store additional information about an HTML element
without having to look for other more complex ways to do so and it's
used as *data-\*,* being "\*" the kind of data we want to store. For
example, inside of a list we could have:

\<li data-animal-type="bird"\>Owl\</li\>

This attribute allows us to lock up custom data on all HTML elements.

It consists of two parts:

-   The attribute name should not have any uppercase letters and must be
    > at least one character long after the "data-"

-   The attribute value can be any string.

### **Accessibility** 

It is a good practice to always try to code HTML keeping accessibility
in mind as it provides the user a good way to navigate and interact with
our site.

We always try to make our HTML code as semantic as possible, this means
that we are using the correct element for their correct purpose.
Semantic elements are elements with a specific meaning; if you want a
button, then use the \<button\> element.

Having a semantic HTML code provides non-vident users to have a
comfortable experience with our page providing screen readers the
context they need to read the information out loud.

> Continuing with the button example:

-   Buttons have more suitable styling by default.

-   A screen reader identifies it as a button.

-   They are clickable :D.

A button is also accessible for users relying on keyboard-only
navigation, as it can be clicked with both keyboard and mouse.

Some examples of semantic elements are: \<form\>, \<table\> and
\<article\> as it clearly defines its content. And some non-semantic
elements are: \<div\> and \<span\> as it does not clarify its content.

Headings are also important for the accessibility of users, as search
engines use the headings to index the content of our web page. It is
important to use them to organize the document structure and the
relationship between different sections of said document. Screen readers
also use headings as a navigational tool! The difference between
headings specify the outline of the page, starting by \<h1\> as the most
important and going down.

Remember also the \<alt\> element, mentioned earlier and used to give an
readable alternative to an image.

We can (and should) even declare the language at the beginning inside
the \<html\> tag, like this: \<html lang="en"\>. With this we can
provide some assistance to the browsers and engines.

A clear an easy to understand language is a must, we try as much as
possible to avoid characters that can't be read by a screen reader,
following rules like:

-   Keeping sentences as short as we can.

-   Avoiding dashes. Instead of "1-3", we type "1 to 3".

-   Avoiding abbreviations and slang words.

Creating good link texts is also really valuable. A link text should
explain clearly what information the user is gonna get when clicking on
it. A good link text example is "learn more about HTML accessibility"
instead of "click here" or "read more".

# **SEO**

Stands for "Search Engine Optimization" and it is the process of
improving your website so the visibility of it can be increased when
people search for products or services related to your page in a search
engine. The better visibility your site gets, the more likely you are to
gain attention and attract existing customers to your business.

Search engines use bots to crawl pages on the web, going between sites
and gathering information about said pages and putting them into an
index to help us find exactly what we're looking for.

Next, an algorithm analyzes the pages on the index taking into account
hundreds of ranking factors or signals to determine the order in which
pages should appear in the search results.

# **DOM** 

The Document Object Model is a programming API (Application Programming
Interface) for HTML and XML documents and it defines the logical
structure of documents and the way the document is accessed and
manipulated.

With this, we can create and build documents, navigate their structure
and add, modify or delete elements and content. Anything found in an
HTML or XML document can be accessed, modified, deleted or added using
the DOM.

One important objective for the DOM is to provide a standard programming
interface that can be used in a wide variety of environments and
applications. The Document Object Model can be used with any programming
language.

With this, documents have a logical structure which resembles very much
like a tree or a mental map. This model specifies the logical model for
the programming interface and this logical model may be implemented in
any way that a particular implementation finds convenient. For example,
we'll take this extract from an HTML document:

\<TABLE\>

\<ROWS\>

\<TR\>

\<TD\>Shady Grove\</TD\>

\<TD\>Aeolian\</TD\>

\</TR\>

\<TR\>

\<TD\>Over the River, Charlie\</TD\>

\<TD\>Dorian\</TD\>

\</TR\>

\</ROWS\>

\</TABLE\>

The Document Object Model will represent it like this:

![](vertopal_af37018e995a4078973b558dd93d87fc/media/image6.png){width="4.598958880139983in"
height="2.725308398950131in"}

# 

# 

# 

# 

# **CSS**

Along with HTML and JS, CSS is part of the most used programming
languages. If HTML focuses on the skeleton of the page and JS on its
functionality, CSS will be focused on the styling of said page.

CSS stands for "Cascade Styling Sheet" and describes how HTML elements
should be displayed. It saves a lot of work and can control the layout
of multiple web pages all at once. It's used to define styles for our
web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for
different devices and screen sizes.

###  **Syntax** 

A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration
block.![](vertopal_af37018e995a4078973b558dd93d87fc/media/image8.png){width="4.359375546806649in"
height="1.059359142607174in"}

The selector points out the HTML element we want to style. The
declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by
semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and value,
separated by a colon. Multiple CSS declarations are separated with
semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

### **Selectors** 

Selectors are used to find or select the HTML elements we want to style
and we can divide them into five categories: simple selectors (which are
elements based on name, id, class), combinator selectors (these select
elements based on a specific relationship between them), pseudo-class
selectors (select elements based on a certain state), pseudo-elements
selectors (which select and style a part of an element) and attribute
selectors (that select elements based on an attribute or an attribute
value).

###  **How to integrate CSS**

There are three ways that we can use to insert a style sheet into our
project: with [external CSS]{.ul}, [internal CSS]{.ul} or [inline
CSS.]{.ul}

**External CSS**

With an external style sheet, we can change the look of an entire
website by changing just one file. Each HTML page must include a
reference to the external style sheet file inside the \<link\> element,
inside the \<head\> element.

An external stylesheet can be written in any text editor and must be
saved with a .css extension. The external .css file should not contain
any HTML tags.

It is important to note that we do not add a space between the property
value and the unit.

**Internal CSS**

This one may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. The
internal style is defined inside the \<style\> element, inside the head
section of an HTML page.

**Inline CSS**

This style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To
use inline styles, we must add the attribute to the relevant element.
Said attribute can contain any CSS property. Though, inline styles loses
many of the advantages of a style sheet by mixing content with
presentation; it's recommended to use this method sparingly.

###  **Multiple style sheets**

If some properties have been defined for the same selector/element in
different style sheets, the value from the last read stylesheet will be
used.

###  **Cascading order** 

### All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

1.  ### Inline style (inside an HTML element).

2.  External and internal style sheets (in the head section).

3.  Browser default.

### **Specificity** 

If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the
selector with the highest specificity value will "win" and its style
declaration will be applied to that HTML element.

Specificity could be thought of as a score or rank that determines which
style declarations are ultimately applied to an element. There are four
categories which define the specificity level of a selector:

-   Inline styles: \<h1 style="color: pink;"\>

-   IDs: \#navbar

-   Classes, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors: .test, :hover,
    > \[href\]

-   Elements and pseudo-elements: h1, :before

###  **Box model**

All HTML elements can be considered as boxes.

In CSS, the term "box model" is used when we talk about design and
layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every
HTML element. It consists of: margings, borders, padding and the actual
content. Like this:

The *content* defines the content of the box, where text and images are
shown. The *padding* clears an area around the content and it's
transparent. The *border* goes around the padding and content. The
*margin* clears an area outside the border and it is also
transparent.![](vertopal_af37018e995a4078973b558dd93d87fc/media/image5.png){width="6.354166666666667in"
height="2.8673906386701664in"}

This model allows us to add a border around elements and to define space
between elements.

[Width and height of an element]{.ul}

In order to set these characteristics correctly in all browsers, we need
to know the box model works. It is important to note that when we set
the width and height of an element in CSS, we just have to set the width
and height of the content area. To calculate the full size of an
element, we must also add padding, orders and margins. For example, this
\<div\> element will have a total width of 350px:

> div {
>
> width: 320px;
>
> padding: 10px;
>
> border: 5px solid gray;
>
> margin: 0;
>
> }

And we calculate it this way:

320px (width)

-   20px (left + right padding)

-   10px (left + right border)

-   0px (left + right margin)

> = 350px
>
> The total width of an element should be calculated like this:
>
> Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left
> border + right border + left margin + right margin.
>
> The total height of an element should be calculated like this:
>
> Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top
> border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin.

### **Media queries**

A media query is a CSS technique that uses the "\@media" rule to include
a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true. For
example:

If the browser window is 900px or smaller, the background color will be
lightblue:

\@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {

body {

background-color: lightblue;

}

}![](vertopal_af37018e995a4078973b558dd93d87fc/media/image13.png){width="5.473958880139983in"
height="3.4385148731408575in"}

Media queries can help for when a web page does not behave equally on
all screen sizes by adding a breakpoint where certain parts of the
design will behave differently on each side of the breakpoint.

It is recommended to always design for mobile first because this will
make the page display faster on smaller devices.

This means that we must make some changes in our CSS. Instead of
changing styles when the width gets smaller than 768px, we should change
the design when the width gets larger than 768px. This will make our
design Mobile First.

We can add as many breakpoints as you like. We will also insert a
breakpoint between tablets and mobile phones. We do this by adding more
media queries (at 600px), and a set of new classes for devices larger
than 600px (but smaller than 768px). If we are working with columns,
having two sets of identical classes gives us the opportunity in HTML to
decide what will happen with the columns at each breakpoint.

There are tons of screens and devices with different heights and widths,
so it is hard to create an exact breakpoint for each device. To keep
things simple you could target five groups.

Media queries can also be used to change the layout of a page depending
on the orientation of the browser. We can have a set of CSS properties
that will only apply when the browser window is wider than its height, a
so called "Landscape" orientation.

Another common use of media queries is to hide elements on different
screen sizes.

We can also use media queries to change the font size of an element on
different screen sizes.
